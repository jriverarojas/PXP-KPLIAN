   instructions on where to find this library. Please refer to
   the manual section "Verifying your PHP installation"

   httpd sever can access them. 
   For a global site installation you should copy the files to

   for cache directory and TTF directory suits your installation. 
   Note1: The default directories are different depending on if

   directory if you enable the cache feature. By default the cache
   is disabled.
